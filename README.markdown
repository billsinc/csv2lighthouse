Import tickets from a CSV file into Lighthouse.
----------

For the moment, the CSV file can only have 5 fields:

    title,description,tags,state,milestone

in that order, lowercase and with no spaces between each header name.

Requires the [Lighthouse API](http://github.com/Caged/lighthouse-api/tree/master).
